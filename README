# mmaze

Originally destined to be code for a maze-solving robot, this has evolved into
a collection of code for working with embedded arm processors.

## Organization

 - arch
 - chip -> arch
 - generic
 - application

## Config notes

 - board provides chip
 - chip provides arch
 - app might provide board, but shouldn't need to (ideally, we'd allow all
   boards that meet certain requriments to be used).

 - generic code uses config from all sources (board, chip, arch, app)


## Debugging

### Redbear BLE nano CMSIS-DAP

 - serial device (/dev/ttyACM0)
 - openocd cmsis-dap
	- `sudo openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/nrf51.cfg`
	- `gdb -ex 'target extended-remote localhost:3333'`
