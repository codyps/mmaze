# What does a pluggable scheduler require from the hardware/arch?

 - some way to interrupt things in the future (timer of some sort)
 - context saving & switching

# What do users require from a scheduler?

 - threads api? (c11, pthreads, pth, l4)

# Isolation Qs

 - What level of control over interrupts (handlers and enable/disabling) should
   be owned by the scheduler

# API

arch or chip:

 - sched_timer_set(uint32_t us);
 - in interrupt, call sched_timer_expired()
 - TODO: timer_expired likely needs some additional parameters to enable task saving
 - TODO: context switching, in the yielding case might be efficiently handled by a software interrupt
 - need to set up timer & interrupt when required by sched
 - delay init or always pre-init

sched:

 - sched_thread_init(struct thread *t);
 - stop, start
 - delete?
 - sched_tick(), or avoid this.
 - sched_run();
 - a way to wait/block on things and later unblock

# Consider:

 - Do we ever want to have multiple sched instances?
